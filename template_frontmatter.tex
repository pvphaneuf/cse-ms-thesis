\begin{abstract}
%Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) is a tool for studying biological molecular mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics through coupling with whole genome sequencing. Academic and industrial labs involved in the study of microbial evolution and metabolic engineering use ALE methodologies in their research for exploring adaptive mutations \cite{ASM:/content/journal/microbe/10.1128/microbe.6.69.1}. These labs build custom post-processing and computational pipelines for the analysis of the ALE genomic output, though ALE methodologies often include the same fundamental steps to interrogate the evolutionary trajectory of the organisms under study. This thesis will detail the strategies and computational tools used in the ALE project pipeline executed by UCSD's Systems Biology Research Group (SBRG) and describe a system for compiling and analyzing ALE results. This thesis can contribute to the domain of ALE methodologies by detailing an approach to the computational analysis of ALE experiments, will propose a method for hypothesizing key mutations and will explore global trends for all ALE experiment data accumulated. These computational tools and protocols to identifying key mutations and global trends will be leveraged, implemented and evaluated in our ALE Analytics software pipeline and web platform. We therefore hypothesize that we can leverage existing ALE foundational technologies and methodologies to develop a bioinformatics system that will accurately predict the key mutations of ALE experiments and provide context on global mutational trends and correlated experimental conditions.
